description = This extension provides LDAP support for TYPO3 by delegating the authentication
      of frontend and/or backend users to the centrally-managed directory of your organization.
      It fully supports OpenLDAP and Active Directory and is capable of connecting securely to
      the authentication server using either TLS or SSL (ldaps://).
      In case of use in an intranet environment, this extension is a perfect match since it
      natively brings Single Sign-On (SSO) capability to TYPO3 without any complex configuration.
